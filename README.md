# MRT-Ticekting-System
The MRT Ticketing System is designed to reduce the ever-rising covid cases and 
innovate the current procedures following the Industry Revolution 4.0 paradigm as technology 
has been evolving drastically. 
This system will be very much beneficial to society as users have everything at their 
fingertips. This system achieves its main motive, which is to create a sustainable, safe 
environment for the users of MRT. Users' comfort and safety are prioritised at all costs. 
This system doesn't exist. Therefore, it has the potential to be easily recognised and 
widely used by the MRT Putrajaya Line users. This system is ideal as anyone can access it at 
any time. Users are also able to carry out multiple actions. The Admin can also monitor and 
continuously improve the website for the users so that they can have the best experience.
